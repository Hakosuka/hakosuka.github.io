After binging on this show, I couldn't help but go for seconds. And thirds. And then wash it down with Fight Milk.

But a problem arose. Firstly, Fight Milk is pretty much a chemical weapon, but secondly I couldn't decide on an episode to watch, So, what better than just picking at random? Plus, I might as well brush up my portfolio.

Inspired by tobster30's Peep Show Episode Picker.
